<p>
The Colibri service requires the user to authenticate in the
<a href="https://confluence.fccn.pt/display/RCTSAAI/RCTSaai+Home">RCTSaai federation</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The authentication process is performed by you, on your institution's server, using the
  credentials that you normally use on the network in other internal services such as your institutional e-mail
  or when you access the eduroam wireless network.
